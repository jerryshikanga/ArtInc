bids logic
** currently when user bids on a product the amount is deducted from his account automatically. This occurs even when multiple users bid on the same product which is wrong.
**New Algorithm
Users bid on a product but their amount is not subtracted
On every set period intervals or at close of bid the highest bid is selected and the amount subtracted from the users account
Product is cleared from the products list
